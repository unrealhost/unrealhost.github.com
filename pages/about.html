        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <dl>
            <dt>Your preferred name and other information that you would like to share about yourself.</dt>
            <dd>Hello, my name is Ethan. I'm a second year student at Mesa that's trying to learn about web development. When I'm not at school, I'm probably at work as a projectionist, both film and digital, or going on weekend trips in my Jeep.</dd>
            <dt>Tell us about your web design skill set.</dt>
            <dd>I have designed a few websites before for personal projects or for class and I use GitHub to host them all. I've got a long history with computers and I am fairly confident with the basic web languages like CSS and HTML, but hardware is my prefered area.</dd>
            <dt>Why are you taking WEBD 168?</dt>
            <dd>I'm taking this course to eventually get a degree in web development because it's something that I enjoy and it's a skill that is sought after. </dd>                    
            <dt>Tell us about your other activities this semester.</dt>
            <dd>This semester I'm also taking a web database course and one on creating user centered content to get my skills a bit more rounded and also to get closer to completing the degree requirements. I work as a projectionist most nights and I often end up leaving in the early hours in the morning, so my goal is to attend all the class sessions this semester.</dd>         
            <dt>Describe what you would like to be doing 5 years from now. Be as detailed as possible. There is a saying, "If you can dream it, you can achieve it!</dt>
            <dd>In five years I'd like to have a stable job that would allow me to "work from home" while living on the road, although it'll  probably take more than five years to get there I'm still hoping.</dd>
