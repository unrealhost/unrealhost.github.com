Hello, my name is Ethan. I'm a second year student at Mesa that's trying to learn about web development. When I'm not at school, I'm probably at work as a projectionist, both film and digital, or going on weekend trips in my Jeep.

Tell us about your web design skill set:
^
I have designed a few websites before for personal projects or for class and I use GitHub to host them all. I've got a long history with computers and I am fairly confident with the basic web languages like CSS and HTML, but hardware is my prefered area.

Why are you taking WEBD 168?
^
I'm taking this course to eventually get a degree in web development because it's something that I enjoy and it's a skill that is sought after. 

Tell us about your other activities this semester:
^
This semester I'm also taking a web database course and one on creating user centered content to get my skills a bit more rounded and also to get closer to completing the degree requirements. I work as a projectionist most nights and I often end up leaving in the early hours in the morning, so my goal is to attend all the class sessions this semester.

Describe what you would like to be doing 5 years from now. Be as detailed as possible. There is a saying, "If you can dream it, you can achieve it!"
^
In five years I'd like to have a stable job that would allow me to "work from home" while living on the road, although it'll  probably take more than five years to get there I'm still hoping.
